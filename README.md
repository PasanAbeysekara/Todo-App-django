# Todo-App-django
* todo app using django as backend framework I'm not done any frontend styling ,so you can easily only focus on django.

* In these source files I try my best to upload all the files but,
there may be some missing files becouse github don't allow to upload empty files . 

* So ,if you are reffering this, I strongly recommand you to not to run 'manage.py' file becouse
that may not be working in your computer. 

* Instead you can create tour own "ToDo" project in your computer
and copy these code in to corresponding files.
  
eg:- 
* First you need to create project using "django-admin startproject todo"
* Next you need to create 'tasks' app using "cd todo" -> "python3 manage.py startapp tasks"
       Then you can fall along with this repo and copy corresponding code to your files
