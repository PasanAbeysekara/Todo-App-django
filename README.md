# Todo-App-django
todo app using django as backend framework

-In these source files I try my best to upload all the files but, there may be some missing files becouse github don't allow to upload empty files . So ,if you are reffering this, I strongly recommand you to not to run 'manage.py' file becouse that may not be working in your computer. Instead you can create tour own "ToDo" project in your computer and copy these code in to corresponding files.
  eg:- First you need to create project using "django-admin startproject todo"
       Next you need to create 'tasks' app using "cd todo" -> "python3 manage.py startapp tasks"
       Then you can fall along with this repo and copy corresponding code to your files
